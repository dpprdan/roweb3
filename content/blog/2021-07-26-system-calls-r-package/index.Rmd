Have you ever found a non-R tool that's perfect for getting your job done, and decided to somehow wrap it into an R package?
E.g. some sort of scientific software, a command-line interface (CLI), Python module or JS library?
In this post, we shall review best practice for such wrappers.

## Using the tool without calling the system

Before jumping to find ways to control the tool with system commands, you might try and find ways to not have to do that.

* Maybe there's a C library offering similar features to the CLI, like libmagick does for Magick? [blog post about ijtiff](/blog/2018/04/12/ijtiff/). For C libraries https://blog.davisvaughan.com/2019/03/02/now-you-c-me/ For C++ Rcpp or https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/cpp11.html (see https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html for the motivations of cpp11)
* In the case of a Python module, you can use the reticulate package for interacting with Python.
* In the case of a JS library, you can use the V8 package.
* https://github.com/ropensci/nlrx "NetLogo is executed in a Java virtual machine". babette https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/01/28/babette/ (both nlrx and babette are examples of scientific software wrappers mentioned in the scope policy of the dev guide)
* Very ambitious, _port_ rather than _wrap_. E.g. vcr port of Ruby vcr gem, NetlogoR https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.04516

## system() and system2()

What does sanitizing mean, examples.

antiword good example of wrapper as it's so small https://github.com/ropensci/antiword/blob/master/R/antiword.R yet useful (and all readers should know about Word)

## sys vs processx

https://github.com/jeroen/sys "Drop-in replacements for the base system2() function with fine control and consistent behavior across platforms. Supports clean interruption, timeout, background tasks, and streaming STDIN / STDOUT / STDERR over binary or text connections. Arguments on Windows automatically get encoded and quoted to work on different locales."

https://github.com/r-lib/processx "Tools to run system processes in the background. It can check if a background process is running; wait on a background process to finish; get the exit status of finished processes; kill background processes. It can read the standard output and error of the processes, using non-blocking connections. 'processx' can poll a process for standard output or error, with a timeout. It can also poll several processes at once." used in e.g. https://github.com/r-lib/pingr#readme
