Have you ever found a non-R tool that's perfect for getting your job done, and decided to somehow wrap it into an R package?
E.g. some sort of scientific software, a command-line interface (CLI), Python module or JS library?
In this post, we shall review best practice for such wrappers.

## Using the tool without calling the system

Before jumping to find ways to control the tool with system commands, you might try and find ways to not have to do that.

* Maybe there's a C library offering similar features to the CLI, like libmagick does for Magick? [blog post about ijtiff](/blog/2018/04/12/ijtiff/). 
* In the case of a Python module, you can use the reticulate package for interacting with Python.
* In the case of a JS library, you can use the V8 package.
* https://github.com/ropensci/nlrx "NetLogo is executed in a Java virtual machine"
* Very ambitious, _port_ rather than _wrap_. E.g. vcr port of Ruby vcr gem, NetlogoR https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.04516
